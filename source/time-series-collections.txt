You can create time series collections using the MongoDB Playground. 

Create a time series collection
-------------------------------

Once you connect your deployment using MongoDB for VS code, use the left 
navigation to: 

1. Expand an active connection and hover over the database where you want 
   your collection to exist.

#. Click the :icon-fa5:`plus` icon that appears. 

#. A MongoDB playground automatically opens with a template form to create 
   both regular collections and time series collections.

#. Save the playground as a ``.mongodb`` file.

#. Delete the regular collection form and uncomment the time series form.

#. Fill in the provided fields accordingly.

#. To run the playground, click the :guilabel:`Play Button` in the top right
   of the VS code navigation bar.

#. After running the playground with the time series collection, the left 
   navigation will update the collection icon to identify it is a 
   time series collection.

To add documents to the time series collection, you can use the

or the 
:manual:`insertMany() </reference/method/db.collection.insertMany>` method.
